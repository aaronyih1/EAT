#EAT: A COLLABORATIVE GUIDE TO PRACTICAL NUTRITION

##Objective
-----------
It is well-known in fitness communities that nutrition is far more important than excercise when trying to get leaner or more muscular. The purpose of this guide is to provide a starting point for people interested in a nutritional plan that does not intrude on your current lifestyle (ie. no scales or strange eating schedules).

##The Vision
------------
The project will start with my personal nutrition rules supported with reasoning and supporting resources when necessary. Overtime, I hope that others will like to contribute their own findings and meal plans so that we can create a giant repository of possible meal plans supported with sound reasoning. Since every person responds differently to different meal and workout plans, having a bunch of tried and true options means that we will be able to find combinations that best suit our bodies.
