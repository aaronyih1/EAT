#EAT: A COLLABORATIVE GUIDE TO PRACTICAL NUTRITION

##Objective
It is well-known in fitness communities that nutrition is far more important than excercise when trying to get leaner or more muscular. The purpose of this guide is to provide a starting point for people interested in a nutritional plan that does not intrude on your current lifestyle (ie. no scales or strange eating schedules).

##Vision
The project will start with my personal nutrition rules supported with reasoning and supporting resources when necessary. Overtime, I hope that others will like to contribute their own findings and meal plans so that we can create a giant repository of possible meal plans supported with sound reasoning. Since every person responds differently to different meal and workout plans, having a bunch of tried and true options means that we will be able to find combinations that best suit our bodies. 

##Regimin
My meal plan is intended for increasing muscle mass without putting on extra fat. I use it in conjunction with compound workouts 4 times a week: 2 low repetition high weight days followed by a break day and 2 high repetition days. 
There are only 2 rules:

1. no refined grains (white flour, white rice, etc)
2. no added sugar 
3. protein : fat ratio greater than 1

Number 1 means no pasta or bread (unless it's 100% whole wheat), nothing with bread crumbs, no pastries, no pancakes, etc. The principle behind this rule is that processed grains have lost all nutritional value that is stored in the bran and germ. During refinement processes these are removed leaving only the Endosperm of which the primary function is energy production. This means that consumption of simple carbs like these are processed very quickly and as a result cause a spike in the blood glucose levels. It is in response to this spike that your body produces insulin in order to balance it out and store it as fat.

Number 2 means no candy, no popsicles, no chocolate, no ice cream, no soda, pretty much no sauces (since most have some hidden added sugar), etc. I also avoid fruit juices since they lack the fiber which slows down the breakdown of sugar. Since sugars are also simple carbs, the justification for number 1 also follows for number 2.

Number 3 means no fatty proteins like bacon, rib eye, cheese, pork chops, etc. This rule is knid of arbitrary except for the fact that fats are more calorically dense than other macro nutrients (carbs and proteins). They pack 9 calories per gram vs 4. As a result, we need to eat less to get the same amount of energy. Excess energy means it gets stored as fat, so we want to avoid that.

Okay, so what can I eat and drink if I can't eat all of those things?

Drink: water, tea, coffee w/ no sugar or creme, cappucino/latte with nonfat milk
Eat: balanced meals with protein, complex carbs, and fats

###classic breakfast

3-5 egg scramble with a ton of shredded mozzerella cheese (check the macros, often I find them with 6g of fat and 8g of protein) + avocado toast with balsamic vinegar (make sure there's no added sugar) + glass of non-fat milk

###classic lunch
steak tacos (flap meat or skirt steak or flat iron or flank) + whole wheat tortilla + avocado slices + water

###classic dinner
grilled chicken thighs + oven broiled broccoli tossed in EVOO + water
